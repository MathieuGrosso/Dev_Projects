<h2 id="arc">Le tir à l'arc</h2>

<p>... - Bien préciser ce que l’on fait :
    1. On fait un algo, donc en gros un SAS. Juste on vend un service. Ils ont du coup besoin encore des humains qui prennent en vidéo/photo les produits finis. On analyse ces images et on dit “oui” ou “non”. Comment vendre ça ? Produit moins cher car on installe rien, on vend que le service mais coût plus important pour eux car toujours besoin d’humains. Néanmoins :  **on est utile quand même, on permet d’avoir une meilleur accuracy** **et on réduit le cout de l’erreurs.** 
    2. Autre possibilité:  On fait un caméra, du coup on doit mettre enplace une chiane de production, un tapis ou tout les volants roulent et sont filmés puis envoyés à nous et algo teste si oui ou nous—> **plus besoin d’humain + meilleure accuracy mais plus gros cout.** 
    3. Autre solution ? ...</p>
